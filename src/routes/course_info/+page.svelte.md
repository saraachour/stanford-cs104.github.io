# Course Info

## Lectures

Monday and Wednesday classes will be designated for lectures on new material. Bringing your computer
is highly recommended, so that you can follow along.

Attendance is not required but highly encouraged. Lectures will NOT be recorded, but slides and/or
notes will always be available on the class Google Drive.

The lectures in this course are not self-contained! Each class session will cover a different topic,
but you will find that the topics covered on Monday and Wednesday of any given week will be closely
related.

The course will build upon topics covered earlier in the course. For instance, Lecture 7 (Version
Control) will expect that you are broadly familiar with what was covered in Lecture 1 (The Shell and
Shell Tools).

## Labs

Fridays will be designated for lab sections, and give you an opportunity to practice what you
learned in the Monday and Wednesday lectures. We will provide semi-guided exercises to help you
better master the material and ask that you complete a set of questions in-class.

There will be 8 weekly lab exercises that are to be completed in the lab section. These exercises will
usually be due at midnight on the same day, unless indicated otherwise. All lab exercises will be submitted 
on [Gradescope]({gradescope}). We expect these lab exercises be completed during lab time. We also strongly 
recommend you come to class, especially  for some of the later lab sections which have pair exercises 
and require access to in-class resources that will be taken down at the end of lab section.


## Assignments

There will be 8 weekly assignments for the course as well as a final project. Assignments will
usually be due on Mondays at 11:59 PM, unless indicated otherwise on the assignment handout or the
course schedule. All assignments will be submitted on [Gradescope]({gradescope}). Each student will
be allowed a total of 3 late days for assignments, which may be spent in units of one day (24 hours)
on any assignment throughout the quarter. You do not need to inform us when taking late days; we'll
use Gradescope submission times to figure them out. There will be no exams in this course.

## Office Hours

Our office hours timings are listed on the [homepage]({base}). We will try to maintain a regular
weekly schedule, but we may have to make adjustments as the quarter progresses. You can also get
help on [Ed]({edstem}).

## Grading Policy

CS104 is graded on a letter grade or CR/NC basis for 3 units. We expect everyone to do well in this
course! The grading breakdown out of 100 points is as follows:

- Each weekly assignment (1 thru 8) is worth 8 points.
- Each weekly lab writeup is worth 2 points.
- The final project is worth 15 points.
- The welcome survey and assignment 0 are each worth 2.5 points.

## Honor Code

As in all Stanford classes, you are expected to follow the Stanford Honor Code. Work submitted for
grading should not be derived from or influenced by the work of others. Do your own thinking, your
own design, your own coding, and your own debugging. Any assistance you receive must remain within
acceptable limits. Truthful citations must be made where required. All submissions are subject to
plagiarism detection tools. Suspected violations are referred to the Community Standards office.

## Students with Documented Disabilities

Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate
the request with the Student Disability Resource Center (SDRC) located within the Office of
Accessible Education (OAE). SDRC staff will evaluate the request with required documentation,
recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the
current quarter in which the request is being made. Students should contact the SDRC as soon as
possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563
Salvatierra Walk.
