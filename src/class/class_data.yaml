      We defined what "the shell" is, went over the history/background of the UNIX operating system and the shell as we know it today, and covered how to use basic shell commands.

      Useful Resources:
        * `man` pages (the system manual)
        * [cheat.sh](https://cheat.sh)
        * [devhints.io/bash](https://devhints.io/bash)

      I used a non-standard command `bat` in my lecture demo; the software installation page contains installation instructions if you want to try it out.

  # Week 2
  - topic: 'Lecture 3: Data Manipulation'
    details: |-
      We will learn how to efficiently process large datasets (or any other text-based data) from the shell using tools like regular expressions.
  - topic: 'Lecture 4: Shell Scripting'
    details: |-
