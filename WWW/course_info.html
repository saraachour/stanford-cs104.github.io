        <h1>Course Info</h1>
        <h2>Lectures</h2>
        We will publish lecture notes as well as slides for each lecture for
        anyone who misses or cannot attend in-person class. While our room does
        have a recording system, the audio and video quality doesn't seem to be
        great. We'll post what we have on Canvas, but we'd still strongly
        recommend attending in person if you can---we can't make any guarantees
        about the quality of the recording for any given lecture.

        <h2>Assignments</h2>
        There will be 8 weekly assignments for the course as well as a final
        project. Assignments will usually be due on Mondays at 11:59 PM, unless
        indicated otherwise on the assignment handout or the course schedule.
        All assignments will be submitted on Gradescope. Each student will be
        allowed a total of 3 late days for assignments, which may be spent in
        units of one day (24 hours) on any assignment throughout the quarter.
        There will be no exams in this course.

        <h2>Office Hours</h2>
        Our office hours will be held by instructors at a time to be determined.
        They will be a mix of in-person and remote. You can also get help on
        <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/33103">Ed</a>.

        <h2>Grading Policy</h2>
        CS45 is graded on a Satisfactory / No Credit basis. We expect that
        everyone should be able to earn a grade of satisfactory. Your course
        grade will be based on your assignment scores, final project score, and
        weekly surveys. You get an S if you earn 25 points in the class:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Each weekly assignment (1 thru 8) is worth 3 points (Assignment 0 is
            worth 1 point).
          </li>
          <li>Each weekly survey is worth 0.5 points.</li>
          <li>The final project is worth 5 points</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Honor Code</h2>
        <p>
          As in all Stanford classes, you are expected to follow the Stanford
          Honor Code. Work submitted for grading should not be derived from or
          influenced by the work of others. Do your own thinking, your own
          design, your own coding, and your own debugging. Any assistance you
          receive must remain within acceptable limits. Truthful citations must
          be made where required. All submissions are subject to plagiarism
          detection tools. Suspected violations are referred to the Community
          Standards office.
        </p>

        <h2>Students with Documented Disabilities</h2>
        <p>
          Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of
          a disability must initiate the request with the Student Disability
          Resource Center (SDRC) located within the Office of Accessible
          Education (OAE). SDRC staff will evaluate the request with required
          documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an
          Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which
          the request is being made. Students should contact the SDRC as soon as
          possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations.
          The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk.
